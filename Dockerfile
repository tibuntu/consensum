# Minimal Prisma CLI for `migrate deploy` on startup. Installed with npm so the
# tree is flat and symlink-free (COPYs cleanly into distroless). The Prisma 7
# CLI eagerly requires its bundled subsystems (Studio, the pglite dev DB) even
# for `migrate deploy`, so those are left intact. Only the leaf SQL drivers for
# other engines — mysql2 and postgres — are dropped: this app is SQLite, and
# they are lazy-loaded, never reached by a SQLite deploy. This tree is kept in
# its own directory at runtime, so it cannot collide with the standalone
# node_modules.

# mismatches the runtime and Prisma tries to download the right one on start —
# which fails on a read-only / non-root Kubernetes filesystem.
