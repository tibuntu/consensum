# Quorum AI

> *"The quorum your agents must clear before building."*

A self-hostable web app that brings team collaboration back into agentic-AI development — **pull-request review, but for the _plan_, before the agent implements.**

---

## Why

> The two paragraphs below are the canonical product positioning — preserved verbatim from the design discussion.

Agentic AI made each developer a silo. Every dev now drives a private Claude Code session whose context and output are invisible to teammates; plans, specs, and tickets get generated and approved by one human + one agent, then implemented — with no point where the **team's** collective judgment enters. The cross-perspective review that made teams strong (a cloud engineer catching an infra problem in a backend dev's approach, a senior's judgment rubbing off on a junior) quietly disappeared. Agentic AI became a fantastic individual force-multiplier and an accidental **collaboration-killer**.

This product re-inserts the team at the highest-leverage moment: **before the agent acts.** It is, in one line, **"pull-request review, but for the *plan* (and the ticket) — before the agent implements."** A developer's agent drafts a plan; instead of solo-approving it, the artifact goes up for **async team review**; the cloud/frontend/backend reviewers weigh in without a meeting; consolidated feedback flows **back into the agent**, which revises, then implements.

## The hero loop

1. A developer's Claude Code agent drafts a plan and runs `/push-plan` → it posts to your Quorum AI instance and hands control back (no blocking).
2. The team gets a shareable link / sees it in their inbox, opens the **rendered** plan, and reviews async: select-to-comment, threads, suggestions, and an **Approve / Request-changes** verdict.
3. The developer runs `/pull-feedback` → the agent receives the **consolidated** team feedback and revises the plan before implementing.

## Status

**M1 (MVP) — shipped.** The full hero loop works end-to-end in a single Docker container:

- **Push** a plan via the Bearer-token machine API (`/push-plan`).
- **Review** it in a production-themed UI: rendered markdown, select-to-comment annotations, comment threads, resolve, and an Approve / Request-changes verdict.
- **Edit** plans into new versions, with annotations **re-anchored** across edits.
- **Live updates** via Server-Sent Events, plus in-app notifications.
- **Pull** consolidated feedback back into the agent (`/pull-feedback`).

Next up is **M2 — Access Control & Collaboration Polish** (authorization, email notifications, version-diff view, dark-mode toggle). See [`docs/superpowers/STATUS.md`](docs/superpowers/STATUS.md) for live build status and [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-04-quorum-ai-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-04-quorum-ai-design.md) for the full design.

## Quickstart

### Run with Docker (recommended)

Quorum AI runs as **one container** with an embedded SQLite database (WAL) — no external services. Data persists in a named volume.

```bash
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32) docker compose up
# → http://localhost:3000
```

Register a user, then create an API token under **Settings → API tokens** for the agent integration below.

### Run locally (development)

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET to a 32+ char random string
CI=true pnpm install      # CI=true required: this repo uses pnpm v11
pnpm db:migrate           # apply migrations to ./data/app.db
pnpm dev                  # → http://localhost:3000
```

## Connecting your agent

The hero loop is driven by two Claude Code slash commands shipped in [`.claude/commands/`](.claude/commands/): [`/push-plan`](.claude/commands/push-plan.md) and [`/pull-feedback`](.claude/commands/pull-feedback.md). They talk to your instance via the machine API. Set:

```bash
export QUORUM_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
export QUORUM_API_TOKEN="<token from Settings → API tokens>"
```

Then from any agent session: `/push-plan` posts the current plan and returns a review URL; once the team weighs in, `/pull-feedback <id>` pulls the consolidated verdict, threads, and digest back so the agent can revise.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19) · Prisma 7 + SQLite (WAL, better-sqlite3 adapter) · better-auth · CodeMirror 6 · react-markdown + remark-gfm · Tailwind CSS 4 · Server-Sent Events. Packaged as a single standalone container.

## Project layout

```
app/            Next.js App Router — pages (app/app/*) + API routes (app/api/*)
components/     React UI (editor, document view, comment sidebar, inbox) + ui/ primitives
lib/            Pure libs → services → helpers: documents, annotations, anchoring,
                reviews, feedback, notifications, tokens, auth, db, SSE events
prisma/         Schema (User, Document, DocumentVersion, Annotation, Comment,
                Review, Notification, ApiToken, …) + migrations
tests/          Vitest unit tests + Playwright e2e (auth, review, versioning, nav)
docs/           Design specs, phase plans, security audit, build status
.claude/        Agent slash commands (/push-plan, /pull-feedback)
```

Architecture convention: **pure libs → services → thin routes → client**, with shared value-sets in `lib/enums.ts`.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test:unit            # Vitest unit tests
pnpm test:e2e             # Playwright e2e (free port 3000 first; webServer rebuilds)
pnpm lint                 # ESLint
```
